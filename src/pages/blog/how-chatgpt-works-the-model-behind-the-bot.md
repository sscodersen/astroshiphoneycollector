<h2 id="1-understanding-language-models">1. Understanding Language Models</h2>
<h3 id="definition-of-language-models">Definition of Language Models</h3>
<p>A language model is a type of artificial intelligence that learns patterns and relationships within language data. It aims to predict the probability of a word or a sequence of words given the context of the preceding words. This prediction power is at the heart of ChatGPT&#39;s remarkable capabilities.</p>
<h3 id="how-language-models-process-text">How Language Models Process Text</h3>
<p>Language models process text by breaking it down into smaller chunks known as tokens. Each token is assigned a numerical representation, making it comprehensible to the machine. The model analyzes these tokens, capturing the essence of the context and establishing associations between words.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-rise-of-transformer-based-models">2. The Rise of Transformer-Based Models</h2>
<h3 id="evolution-of-ai-models">Evolution of AI Models</h3>
<p>Before transformers, traditional language models faced challenges in handling long-range dependencies and contextual information. Transformers revolutionized the AI landscape by addressing these limitations.</p>
