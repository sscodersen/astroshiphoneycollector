<h1 id="1-what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai-">1. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h1>
<p>Artificial Intelligence, commonly referred to as AI, is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, problem-solving, and decision-making.</p>
<p>AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI refers to systems that are designed for a specific task, like virtual assistants or recommendation algorithms. General AI, on the other hand, is hypothetical AI that possesses human-like intelligence and can handle any intellectual task that a human can.</p>
<h2 id="2-how-ai-is-affecting-everyday-life-">2. How AI is Affecting Everyday Life?</h2>
