<h3 id="application-tips-for-flawless-lashes">Application Tips for Flawless Lashes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Preparation:</strong> Ensure your natural lashes are clean and free of any oil or makeup residue. This will help the lash clusters adhere better and last longer. Use a small amount of lash glue to secure the clusters in place, blending them with your natural lashes for a seamless finish ^7^.</li>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Placement:</strong> Apply the clusters from the outer corner of your eye, working your way inward. This technique creates a more natural and lifted look, enhancing your eye shape beautifully ^7^.</li>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Blending:</strong> Use a small amount of lash glue to secure the clusters in place. Blend the clusters with your natural lashes for a seamless finish, ensuring a natural and effortless look ^7^.</li>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Avoid Common Mistakes:</strong> Too much adhesive isnâ€™t advantageous. It can cause lashes to clump or irritate your eyes. Use just a small amount for comfort and security. Avoid placing clusters too close to your eyelidâ€”they can be uncomfortable and damage natural lashes. Position them slightly above the lash line for comfort and a natural appearance ^7^.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="maintenance-and-removal">Maintenance and Removal</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Removal:</strong> Lash clusters can typically be worn for up to a week, depending on the quality of the product and how well they are applied. To remove, gently pull them off starting from the outer corner of your eye, ensuring minimal discomfort and preserving your natural lashes ^7^.</li>
  <li>ðŸ’„ <strong>Reapplication:</strong> If you notice any clusters falling off before the week is up, you can easily reapply them using a small amount of fresh lash glue, maintaining your enhanced look effortlessly ^7^.</li>
</ul>
