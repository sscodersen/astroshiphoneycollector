<h2 id="understanding-extended-reality-xr-">Understanding Extended Reality (XR)</h2>
<p>XR is a universal term encompassing immersive learning technologies like VR, AR, and MR. These technologies augment reality by incorporating digital elements into the real world, creating multisensory and engaging training experiences. The use of XR has gained momentum as organizations seek innovative ways to modernize their corporate training programs.</p>
<p>By incorporating XR into your training initiatives, you can immerse learners in a dynamic and interactive environment that enhances engagement and ensures long-term retention of knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-pillars-of-xr-vr-ar-and-mr">The Three Pillars of XR: VR, AR, and MR</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s explore the primary XR technologies that are reshaping corporate training:</p>
<h2 id="virtual-reality-training-vr-">Virtual Reality Training (VR)</h2>
<p>VR training immerses learners in a simulated environment, enabling them to engage in lifelike interactions with objects and people. There are two primary forms of VR training:</p>
<h3 id="360-vr">360° VR</h3>
<p>360° VR places learners in a fixed position within a pre-recorded video environment, offering a 360° view of the scenario.</p>
<h3 id="full-vr">Full VR</h3>
<p>Full VR creates entirely digital environments, allowing learners to move freely and interact realistically with virtual objects.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-virtual-reality-for-corporate-training">The Cost of Virtual Reality for Corporate Training</h3>
