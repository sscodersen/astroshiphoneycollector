<h3 id="what-are-ai-image-enhancers">What Are AI Image Enhancers?</h3>
<p><strong>AI image enhancers</strong> are software tools that use machine learning‚Äîespecially neural networks like CNNs and GANs‚Äîto improve image quality. They can:
<ul>
  <li>Upscale images up to 2x, 4x, even 8x</li>

<h3 id="how-do-ai-enhancers-work">How Do AI Image Enhancers Work?</h3>

<p>Popular techniques include:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Super-resolution via GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)</strong></li>
