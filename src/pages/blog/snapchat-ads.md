<p>Snapchat ads are a dynamic form of advertising that seamlessly integrates with the platform&#39;s content. These ads appear as full-screen, unobtrusive content that users encounter while browsing through organic posts and Stories.</p>
<p>Snapchat ads can take the form of images or videos, offering flexibility to advertisers. The duration of these ads can range from a concise 3 seconds to a more comprehensive 3 minutes. Importantly, they must adhere to a 9:16 aspect ratio with a minimum resolution of 1080px x 1920px. However, there are two exceptions to this rule: Lens AR and Filters ads, which are interactive and entertaining sponsored elements that users can incorporate into their own content.</p>
