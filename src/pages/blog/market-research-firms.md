<p>Self-serve market research tools are helpful when you need answers fast. But a market research firm can be a great asset when you want data on a more personalized or granular level.</p>
<p>The data collected by a market research firm can help with the optimization of your product marketing, communications strategy, customer experience, online user experience, and more.</p>
<p>From completely bespoke services to expert reporting on the topics that matter most to your audience, these top market research companies offer a variety of services for B2B and B2C brands.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ipsos
Ipsos is a market research company that connects businesses with online communities.</li>
</ol>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>When you work with Ipsos, you&#39;ll be matched with a community of people that share traits with your ideal customers. These similarities help you figure out what your ideal customer or user may respond well to.</p>
<p>Ipsos’ wide range of services covers multiple industries, including retail, healthcare, transportation, politics, and automotive.</p>
<p>With Ipsos, you can do things such as:</p>

<p>Because Ipsos services are so customizable, you’ll need to get in touch with the Ipsos team to discuss your needs and receive a price quote.</p>
<ol>

<ol>
<li>Exploding Topics
Exploding Topics is an alternative to traditional market research firms.</li>
</ol>
<p>undefined</p>
<p>Rather than relying on a small panel sample or audience group selected by a firm, you can glean insights from what might be the world’s largest repository of consumer wants, needs, and insights: the internet.</p>
<p>First, we use artificial intelligence (AI) to listen to conversations happening across:</p>
<p>Websites
Blogs
News outlets
Forums
Social networks
Next, our data analysis experts take this information and identify the top market trends, topics, brands, and technologies that interest consumers and businesses today.</p>
<p>We enter these findings into our searchable database—and use it as the basis for insightful, actionable reports that break down the top trends you need to know about right now.</p>
<p>Our data stretches back 15 years and covers over 30 industries. Plus, it’s updated every day—so you always have fresh insights to work with.</p>

<p>Entry into new markets
Product development
New marketing strategies

New business formation
You can access some of our trend data and reports for free right now. For complete access to every Exploding Topics data point and report—including our Meta Trends feature that shows how trends intersect—you’ll need a paid Exploding Topics Pro plan.</p>
<p>It’s just $1 for the first two weeks of your Exploding Topics Pro membership, and as little as $39 per month (billed annually) after that.</p>
<ol>

<p>As a Gartner customer, you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Forrester
Forrester is a market research firm that provides insights for business, government, and technology operations.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use Forrester insights to:</p>
<p>Explore what business customers need and want
Develop your tech stack to keep pace with competitors
Prepare for supply chain and development challenges
Review prepared sales strategy templates
Discover competitor weaknesses
Forrester offers advisory services and access to data-rich reports, so you can choose whether you’d like to take a more self-directed approach or have help.</p>
<p>A single Forrester report may cost $1,000 or more, and advisory services are custom quoted based on your needs. Anyone interested in working with Forrester directly will need to get in touch with their sales team to discuss options.</p>
<ol>
