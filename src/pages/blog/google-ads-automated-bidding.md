<h2 id="exploring-automated-bidding-in-google-ads">Exploring Automated Bidding in Google Ads</h2>
<p>Over the past year or two, Google Ads has been steadily making changes to its platform that are steering advertisers to use its automated featuresâ€”which advertisers have mixed feelings about.</p>
<p>One of those features is automated bidding. Automated bidding has improved over the years, but it doesn&#39;t make this part of Google Ads any less overwhelming. There are many different types, each one with its pros and cons. So should you use automated bidding? If so, which strategy should you use?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re asking those questions, you&#39;re in the right place! In this guide, you&#39;ll learn:</p>
<h2 id="understanding-the-bidding-landscape">Understanding the Bidding Landscape</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-automated-bidding-">What is automated bidding?</h3>
<p>When you set up a Google Ads campaign, you have to tell Google how much you&#39;re willing to pay for your ad to be shown. This is called your bid, and there are two different ways to set your bids: manual or automated.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Manual Bidding</strong>: In manual bidding, you tell Google the maximum amount you&#39;re willing to pay per click on your ad (CPC), and you can make adjustments to that bid based on your ad&#39;s performance as determined by the metrics available in your reports.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Automated Bidding</strong>: With automated bidding, Google uses automated rules to adjust your bids for you, based on the ad&#39;s likelihood of getting a click or conversion. Automated bidding may use additional data points that aren&#39;t available in reporting metrics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="demystifying-automated-bidding-strategies">Demystifying Automated Bidding Strategies</h3>
<p>There are eight types of automated bidding options in Google Ads:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Cost Per Click (ECPC)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximize Clicks</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximize Conversions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximize Conversion Value</strong></li>
<li><strong>Target Cost Per Action (tCPA)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Target Return on Ad Spend (tROAS)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Viewable CPM (vCPM)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cost Per View (CPV)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="smart-bidding-vs-automated-bidding">Smart Bidding vs. Automated Bidding</h3>
<p>Is Smart bidding the same as automated bidding? Smart Bidding and automated bidding often get used interchangeably, but they&#39;re not the same thing. Smart bidding refers only to Google&#39;s automated bidding strategies that use &quot;auction-time bidding,&quot; meaning it will optimize for conversion or conversion value in each and every auction. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced CPC</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximize Conversions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Maximize Conversion Value</strong></li>
<li><strong>Target CPA</strong></li>
<li><strong>Target ROAS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So while all Smart Bidding strategies are automated, not all automated bidding strategies are Smart Bidding strategies.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-your-bid-strategy">Choosing Your Bid Strategy</h2>
<h3 id="how-do-i-set-my-bid-strategy-">How do I set my bid strategy?</h3>
<p>Once you determine which one is right for you, how do you select it?</p>
<p>It&#39;s important to note that when you&#39;re setting up your campaign, Google will automatically choose an automated bidding strategy for you based on your goals.</p>
<p>You do not have to use this strategy!</p>
<p>You can choose any other automated bidding strategy, or instead choose to bid manually.</p>
<p>Simply select the blue text at the bottom where it says &quot;Select a bid strategy directly (not recommended).&quot;</p>
