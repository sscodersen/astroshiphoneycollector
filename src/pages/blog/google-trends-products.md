<p><strong> Discovering Trending Products with Google Trends</strong></p>
<p>Google Trends is a fantastic resource for tracking the popularity of search terms and topics over time. While it&#39;s often used for content and marketing strategies, it can also be a goldmine for e-commerce entrepreneurs looking to identify trending products.</p>
<p><strong> Navigating Google Trends</strong></p>
<p>To get started, head to Google Trends&#39; homepage and enter a broad keyword related to your niche. For this example, let&#39;s explore the keyword &quot;Men&#39;s Clothing.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="https://example.com/mens-clothing-trend-image" alt="Men&#39;s Clothing Trend"></p>
<p>You&#39;ll notice an &quot;Interest Over Time&quot; chart showing spikes and valleys in search interest for this keyword. For &quot;Men&#39;s Clothing,&quot; significant spikes occur during November and December, likely due to holiday shopping.</p>
<p><strong> Digging Deeper into Trends</strong></p>
<p>Scrolling down, you&#39;ll find valuable data about which regions are most interested in &quot;Men&#39;s Clothing.&quot; This information is crucial for targeted advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>To zero in on specific trending products, utilize the &quot;Related Topics&quot; and &quot;Related Queries&quot; sections. In the case of &quot;Men&#39;s Clothing,&quot; you&#39;ll encounter brands and topics related to this niche.</p>
<p><strong> Refining Your Search</strong></p>
<p>Since &quot;Men&#39;s Clothing&quot; is quite broad, you&#39;ll discover that many related topics are brand names, possibly your competitors. To narrow down your search, select the &quot;Top&quot; option from the dropdown menu to reveal popular searches.</p>
<p>This refinement can lead to more specific product ideas, such as &quot;men&#39;s shirts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong> Exploring Different Categories</strong></p>
<p>If you&#39;re still struggling to find niche products, explore the &quot;All Categories&quot; tab. Let&#39;s assume you want to venture into sports clothing or gear. This shift in focus can reveal sub-niches with stable search interest.</p>
<p><strong> Unearthing Breakout Trends</strong></p>
<p>Just like before, check the &quot;Related Topics&quot; and &quot;Related Queries&quot; tabs for rising and breakout topics, brands, and terms. This process will lead you to more promising product ideas.</p>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve made progress, let&#39;s delve into how you can use Google Trends effectively.</p>
<h2 id="three-strategies-for-using-google-trends">Three Strategies for Using Google Trends</h2>
<h3 id="spot-fad-products-search-terms">Spot Fad Products &amp; Search Terms</h3>
<p><strong> Spotting Fads</strong></p>
<p>Latching onto fad products can be profitable but risky, as their demand can vanish quickly. Steep increases and decreases in search interest often indicate seasonality, which you should consider when choosing products.</p>
<p>Starting with a broader niche can help you avoid potential fads that might not sustain their popularity.</p>
<h3 id="utilize-related-topics-recommendations">Utilize Related Topics Recommendations</h3>
<p><strong> Expanding Your Niche</strong></p>
<p>If you already have an established niche or store, you can use the &quot;Related Topics&quot; method to expand your product offerings. Adjust the settings to &quot;Google Shopping&quot; for product-focused topics and queries.</p>
<p>For example, a massage chair retailer could use these insights to add gaming or 4D massage chairs to their inventory.</p>
<h3 id="check-out-google-s-yearly-shopping-trends-report">Check Out Google&#39;s Yearly Shopping Trends Report</h3>
<p><strong> Yearly Shopping Trends</strong></p>
<p>Google releases an annual shopping trends report, highlighting the top trending products based on Google Shopping data and searches. This report can help you identify products that are currently in demand.</p>
<p>For instance, in December 2022, some trending products included a travel hair dryer, electric bike, stemless wine glass, and aromatherapy diffuser.</p>
