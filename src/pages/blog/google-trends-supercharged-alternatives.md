<p>Google Trends Supercharged, as the name suggests, takes your trend analysis to the next level. It replaces Google Trends metrics with actual search volume numbers, giving you a more accurate picture of trends&#39; popularity. This extension is a game-changer for SEO enthusiasts and digital marketers.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-google-trends-supercharged-h2-">How to Use Google Trends Supercharged </h2>
<p>With this extension, you can toggle between traditional trend views and search volume data effortlessly. Simply click the upper right-hand corner, and you&#39;ll have access to both. Plus, it&#39;s free to use for up to 10 trend searches per month. If you need more, there are affordable paid plans starting at $40 per month (billed annually) or $49 per month (billed monthly).</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s important to note that Google Trends Supercharged exclusively supports Chromium browsers, so you&#39;ll need to use one of those.</p>
